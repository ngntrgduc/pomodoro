# Pomodoro

## Why reinvent the wheel?
I have found some beautiful pomodoro websites like: [Tomato Timers](https://www.tomatotimers.com/), [Pomodoro Kitty](https://pomodorokitty.com/), [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/), [studywithme.io](https://studywithme.io/aesthetic-pomodoro-timer/)... But there are not minimalist, so I have created one.
